David Garson",quote:'ParaMind is another type of brainstorming software. It works by generating new text from your writing, thereby expanding on any idea based on one of hundreds of built-in related word chains, to which the writer can add. As such, it goes beyond common "writer\'s helper" software that may ask the writer questions related to his or her subject, flow charting that writer\'s concepts or generating random word combinations that provide idea variations typed in by the author. In ParaMind, a single sentence or paragraph can be expanded and permuted into up to 100 pages of related statements. In simple "merge" mode, ParaMind operates as a sort of thesaurus, suggesting substitutes for words the writer highlights in text. However, in "large merge" mode, many pages of new, reworded relationships are generated, providing feedback on hundreds of new relationships and associations relevant to the concepts contained in the author\'s original text.'}})],1),this._v(" "),t("div",{staticClass:"flex justify-center"},[t("Testimonial",{attrs:{name:"Don Davis",quote:"A truly GREAT program!",pic:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Don_S._Davis_DF-SD-03-14217.jpg"}})],1),this._v(" "),t("div",{staticClass:"flex justify-center"},[t("Testimonial",{attrs:{name:"Mick D'Aquin-Burglass MD, MPH, MDiv, ThD, MS, MEE, CAS, CMRO, FAAFP, FASAM Harvard Medical School",quote:"This is a MAJOR piece of software!",pic:"https://d38we5ntdyxyje.cloudfront.net/927153/profile/NMZECIJX_avatar_medium_square.jpg"}})],1),this._v(" "),t("div",{staticClass:"flex justify-center"},[t("Testimonial",{attrs:{name:"Rick Anderson",quote:"I've been a fan of this software for years.

I use Paramind to give me new ideas for magic tricks and more importantly for the presentations for effects I create.\nI hadn't used your software in a while and I was searching for it.\nI searched the area of brainstorming and came up with almost exclusively mindmapping programs. I've used those but they tend to only work off what I'm already thinking. Yours creates some random new concepts that seem to spark creative ideas for me.\nI wish your program came up better in the search engine results. It deserves wider recognition.\nI found my older version on an old computer and was disappointed it wouldn't work on my current computers. I'll look forward to using the new version.\nI just paid for the professional upgrade via Paypal.",pic:"https://i1.wp.com/edgewaterecho.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Document.jpeg?w=350&ssl=1"}})],1)])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
